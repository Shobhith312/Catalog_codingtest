# Secret Polynomial Decoder

This project implements a polynomial interpolation algorithm to decode secret values from given data in JSON format. The algorithm uses Lagrange interpolation to compute the constant term based on input points.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later) installed on your machine.
